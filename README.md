WebDev Setup with Vagrant
==================

First a little about passwords: Read all of this
------------------

Sometimes you will be prompted for a password (your computer login password, user account, etc.) when you're installing programs using the terminal window.  When you start typing the password, it will look like it nothing has been typed (eg. nothing will display on the screen as type).  That's totally fine. Your password is being entered, just not shown to you. So keep typing and press enter when you're done typing.  In case you type your password wrong it will prompt you to type in your password again.  Why? So nobody can look over your shoulder and see your password or know how many characters your password has.
